title: Testimony And The Function of Religion

I had the opportunity to attend church for the first time in nearly a year to bless my brother's newborn. Suprisingly, even after being away for so long I felt little anxiety or anticipation today then I had the past few days.  As I walked into the chapel, my first impression was how few people were there.  Even though the church is now on it's two hour schedule there were large amounts of pews that were empty.  My wife and I took our seats towards the front; the 4 rows behind us were completely empty.  As the meeting started, I noticed a few more changes.  The first counselor of the bishopric had a full beard, more women were wearing pants, and most people there were over the age of 50.
